Issue NO.1
	Date
	--> 2012/7/24

	Object
	--> To satisfy requirement of guest account for product, DT724
	
	Description 
	-->	According to specfication of guest account in project, Password can be
		any but at least one character. However, purely setting [user].conf
		couldn't safisfy this requirement so that we need to modify source
		code of samba. 
	
	Value of CFLAG
	--> ARCADYAN_GUEST_PASSWORD_ACCEPT_EXCEPT_NULL_PASSWORD. Default setting
		is enabled, "-DARCADYAN_GUEST_PASSWORD_ACCEPT_EXCEPT_NULL_PASSWORD". 
		If you would like to disable this feature, just set 
		"-UARCADYAN_GUEST_PASSWORD_ACCEPT_EXCEPT_NULL_PASSWORD".
			
	Note
	--> if you want to see contents of password, set "-DDEBUG_PASSWORD" in
		CFLAG which is pre-defined value in samba.

Issue NO.2
	Date
	--> 2012/7/26

	Object
	--> Implement Event Log compatible with specification of product, DT724

	Description
	--> According to specification, two "Event Code" need to be implemented.
		First one, "AS300", means "Smb/Cifs started and running",
		the other one, "AS301", means "Smb/Cifs stopped".

	Value of CFLAG
	--> ARCADYAN_DT_724_SAMBA_EVENT_LOG. Default setting is enabled
		"-DARCADYAN_DT_724_SAMBA_EVENT_LOG",If you would like to disable 
		this feature, just set "-UARCADYAN_DT_724_SAMBA_EVENT_LOG".

Issue NO.3
	Date
	--> 2012/8/10
	
	Object
	--> To satisfy requirement of guest accout in Deutsch

	Description
	--> As a result of this product, DT724, so we change name of guest to
		"gast" in Deutsch.

Issue NO.4
	Date
	--> 2012/8/14
	
	Object
	--> To satisfy requirement of guest account by menas of win7 for product, DT724
	
	Description
	--> Continue from issue NO.1, it only supports NTLMv1 by means of winXP
		below. However, win7 use NTLMv2 to verify user's account. Hence, we
		need to use the same method used by NTLMv1 to satisfy requirement of
		guest accout.

	Value of CFLAG
	--> ARCADYAN_GUEST_PASSWORD_ACCEPT_EXCEPT_NULL_PASSWORD. Default
		setting is enabled, "-DARCADYAN_GUEST_PASSWORD_ACCEPT_EXCEPT_NULL_PASSWORD".
		If you would like to disable this feature, just set
		"-UARCADYAN_GUEST_PASSWORD_ACCEPT_EXCEPT_NULL_PASSWORD".

	Note
	--> add "-UDEBUG_PASSWORD" in Makefile. When we need to solve this kind of
		issue like verfication of user account. we can open this flag to help
		us to observe revelant and inportant information like password...etc.
		And log level should be equal or greater than 3.

Issue NO.5
	Date
	--> 2012/8/24

	Object
	--> To make username is sensitive while user types his account

	Description
	--> When user types his account, the username we get is sensitive, i.e.
		user type "microUSB3", then server would get "microUSB3" instead of
		"microusb3". Next phase, server would try to compare this username coming
		from "/etc/samba/smbpasswd". The oringinal design is that comparison of
		username is in-sensitive, therefore I revise this rule to be snesitive.
		Finally, user need to type exact username because lowercase cahracter is
		different to uppercase character in ascii code.

	Value of CFLAG
	--> ARCADYAN_COMPARISON_OF_USERNAME_IS_SENSITIVE. Default setting is
		enabled, "-DARCADYAN_COMPARISON_OF_USERNAME_IS_SENSITIVE". if you would
		like to disable to become in-sensitive, just set
		"-UARCADYAN_COMPARISON_OF_USERNAME_IS_SENSITIVE"

Issue NO.6
	Date
	--> 2012/8/28

	Object
	--> to make user get the correct [user].conf

	Description
	--> Owing to characteristic of %U, it would be translated to all-lowercase
		word, i.e. "USER" would be translated to "user", then server would use
		"user.conf" if existed. Hence, I revise this design to let %U be
		sensitive. In another word, "USER" uses "USER.conf" and "user" uses
		"user.conf".

	Value of CFLAG
	--> ARCADYAN_PERCENT_U_IN_CONF_FILE_IS_SENSITIVE, default setting is
		enabled, "-DARCADYAN_PERCENT_U_IN_CONF_FILE_IS_SENSITIVE". if you would
		like to disable to become in-sensitive, just set
		"-UARCADYAN_PERCENT_U_IN_CONF_FILE_IS_SENSITIVE".

	Note1
	--> There is dependency with samba of mapi. I define MACRO,
		"ARCADYAN_MAPI_SAMBA_CONF_NAME_SENTITIVE" in
		".../arc-middle_mod_usb/src/private/samba.h", and both need to be enabled
		or disabled simultaneously.

	Note2
	--> For whole design of authentication for user, considering Issue NO.5 and
		NO.6. User types exact username, then get right "username.conf" if
		authentication is passed.

Issue NO.7
	Date
	--> 2012/9/13

	Object
	--> to disable feature, "DNS server query"

	Description
	--> When resolv.conf with name server info, samba server would query DNS
		server then failed after no match infomation in /etc/hosts. However, this
		would cause problem while querying and client/server negotiation would
		be pendding, and server can't send message, "Session Setup AndX Response".  
		So up to now, this issue would be fixed and verified under two conditions while
		manipulating.
		=> 1. type "\\192.168.2.1" in file path bar, or command line.
		   2. refresh the information of network window.

	Value of CFLAG
	--> ARCADYAN_DNS_SERVER_QUERY_DISABLE, default setting is disabled,
		"-UARCADYAN_DNS_SERVER_QUERY_DISABLE" because this issue would not happened 
		in EIT, and which firmware released version is
		0.04.000. This would be enabled, "-DARCADYAN_DNS_SERVER_QUERY_DISABLE" if 
		needed in feature.

Issue NO.8
	Date
	--> 2012/10/3

	Object
	--> Implement Event Log compatible with specification of product, DT724

	Description
	--> Continuous from Issue NO.2, add new event log, F001, F003, F103,
	    F104, for DT724. The detailed meaning as below.
		=> F001
			-> Local user login failed after > 5 unsuccessful attempts
			   {account 'x' blocked for 60 minutes}
		   F003
		    -> ser <username, IP-address> login failed with protocol

		   F103
		    -> User access for reactivated (after 60 min timeout expired)

		   F104
		    -> User with IP-address successfully logged in with protocol
			   <protocol>

		NOTE: In log, F003, in order to avoid continuously logging failed 
			  while clicking icon, speedport, in network window or typing
			  "\\<ip address of LAN" which would trigger sending message,
			  "Session Setup AndX Request" under condition, name of
			  client(name of PC) the same as username of account, set 
			  interval time to 2.5 seconds as threshold. 
			  If client sends two messages in 2.5 seconds, server
			  would judge this action as above, and do not increase time of
			  unsuccessful attempt. 2.5 seconds is tuned by experiment.

	Value of CFLAG
	    --> The same as Issue NO.2. ARCADYAN_DT_724_SAMBA_EVENT_LOG. 
			Default setting is enabled "-DARCADYAN_DT_724_SAMBA_EVENT_LOG". 
			If you would like to disable this feature, just set
			"-UARCADYAN_DT_724_SAMBA_EVENT_LOG".

Issue NO.9
	Date
	--> 2012/11/16

	Object
	--> Implement Event Log compatible with specification of product, DT724

	Description
	--> Continuous from Issue NO.2 & 8, add new event log, F110, F111, for
		DT724. The detailed meaning as below.
		=>F110
		   -> Storage device <devicename> 95% full

		  F111
		   -> Storage device <devicename> 100% full

		NOTE: These two event log need to implement sending mail.

	Value of CFLAG
		--> The same as Issue NO.2 & 8. ARCADYAN_DT_724_SAMBA_EVENT_LOG.
			Default setting is enabled "-DARCADYAN_DT_724_SAMBA_EVENT_LOG".
			If you would like to disable this feature, just set
			"-UARCADYAN_DT_724_SAMBA_EVENT_LOG".

Issue NO.10
	Date
	--> 2012/11/23

	Object
	--> use library, statistic, for event log, F110, F111

	Description
	--> Owing to rapidly checking storage capacity for transmission of many 
		small files, using this library avoiding to frequently access ccfg,
		and also for performance condsideration.
		Up to present, only using in F110 & F111, and type of value is
		integer.

		Note: collaborating with time interval to get good result we wish.

	Valus of CFLAG
		--> Add new flag, ARCADYAN_STASTISTIC_CFG, which is enabled or
			disabled with CONFIG_PACKAGE_libstatistic. If you would like to
			open/close this flag, using "make menuconfig" to control
			"CONFIG_PACKAGE_libstatistic".

Issue NO.L-1
	Date
	--> 2012/11/26
	
	Object
	--> support samba print

	Description
	--> Enable static_init_rpc for SAMBA printer
	
	Valus of CFLAG
		--> None
	
Issue NO.11
	Date
	--> 2012/12/04

	Object
	--> use library, mapi, in place of ccfg command for event log, F001, F003,
		F103, F104

	Description
	--> Continuous from issue NO.8, changing implementation of ccfg command to 
		C API of mapi, which can raise performance and lower CPU loading. 
		NOTE: In log, F103, originally using 2.5 seconds as time threshold 
		between login request, now we use 1.2 seconds as threshold, Also, this
		is experiment value, and test in environment of "log level = 0" which
		is very similiar with real usage.

	Value of CFLAG
	--> Besides ARCADYAN_DT_724_SAMBA_EVENT_LOG, add new flag,
		ARCADYAN_MAPI_CCFG which is enabled to replace ccfg command. 
		Default setting is enabled "-DARCADYAN_MAPI_CCFG". If you would like 
		to disable this feature, just set "-UARCADYAN_MAPI_CCFG". And these
		two flags are independent.

Issue NO.12
	Date
	-->2012/12/20
	
	Object
	-->Increase SMB printer share name length.
	
	Description
	-->samba cannont display the length of printer name more than 15 characters
	The old samba client can only soupport the size of share printer name to be 15.
	Extend the limited size of share printer name from 15 to 32 in local.h. 
	It tested well in WINXP
	
	Valus of CFLAG
	--> None
	

Issue NO.13
	Date
	--> 2012/12/20

	Object
	--> use library, statistic, to replace, library, mapi, for all supported
		event log, F001, F003, F103, F104, F110, F111

	Description
	--> Continuous from issue No.10 & 11, because whole nodes we used are
		run-time items which means these should be reset after rebooting. So
		using libstatistic instead of libmapi to accomplish our design.

	Value of CFLAG
	--> Remove flag, ARCADYAN_MAPI_CCFG, and just use flag,
		ARCADYAN_STASTISTIC_CFG. If ARCADYAN_STASTISTIC_CFG is enabled,
		libstatistic is adopted. Otherwise, libmapi would be used.

Issue NO.13
	Date
	--> 2013/03/05

	Object
	--> Forbid user to access location of "RAMDISK DISK"

	Description
	--> While sharing whole disk, the root path of shared folder is in
		"/tmp/usb/<vendor-ID>-<product-ID>". And user have opportunity to access
		RAMDISK DISK. For security issue, we should forbid this limits of
		authority to prevent malicious damage.

	Value of CFLAG
	--> Add new flag, ARCADYAN_RAMDISK_ACCESS_TO_BE_DENIED, to control this
		feature. Default is enabled this feature,
		-DARCADYAN_RAMDISK_ACCESS_TO_BE_DENIED.

	REMARK: This flag is partially included in flag,
			ARCADYAN_DT_724_SAMBA_EVENT_LOG. However, no effect while enabling
			or disabling this flag.

Issue NO.14
	Date
	--> 2013/04/17

	Object
	--> Handle disk full while printing big files

	Description
	--> Two alternatives we have here on disk full
		One is to skip writing, the other is to terminate print job.
		Terminating print job will not cause pc(smb client) to return to init state,
		pc user has to kill all print job in order to do printing again.

	Value of CFLAG
	--> DARCADYAN_PRINTING_SKIP_WRITE_ON_DISK_FULL
		DARCADYAN_PRINTING_SELF_TERMINATION_ON_DISK_FULL

Issue NO.15
	Date
	--> 2014/01/16

	Object
	--> To support German Aplhabet as password for login

	Description
	--> Originally, DT724 only supoorts US Alphabet as password, however, if we want to
		support german alphabet, need to transform UTF-8 format from UI to
		UTF-16 in smppasswd before doing MD4 hassing so that different OS,
		Windows, Linux and Mac, can use German Alphabet to log in.

	Value of CFLAG
	--> "-DARCADYAN_DT_724_UTF8_TO_UTF16", transform UTF-8 to UTF-16
		"-USMBPASSWD_DEBUG", for debug, default is disable
